ðŸš€ Netflix Data Analysis Project using Excel, MySQL, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

In this project, I explored and analyzed Netflixâ€™s content dataset using a combination of Excel, MySQL, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

Data Import: Imported Netflix data from Excel into MySQL for structured storage and querying.
SQL Analysis:
Counted the number of movies vs TV shows.
Analyzed common content ratings (e.g., PG, R).
Investigated yearly release trends, focusing on content released in different countries.
Python Data Manipulation:
Connected Python to MySQL using a custom class.
Used Pandas to clean, filter, and manipulate the dataset.
Created pivot tables to summarize content by year, type, and rating.
Data Visualization:
Line chart: Showed the top 5 years with the highest number of content releases.
Pie chart: Illustrated the total breakdown of movies vs TV shows.
Bar charts: Displayed content released by country and movie ratings in the U.S.
Scatter charts: Analyzed ratings for movies and TV shows.
Subplots: Compared directors' contributions to movies and TV shows.
Pie charts: Showed the ratio of U.S. content and ratings for TV shows.
Bar chart: Highlighted top countries watching movies over 90 minutes.
Scatter chart: Examined interest in watching shows with more than one season.
ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

Strengthened skills in data importing, querying, and manipulation using Excel, MySQL, Python, and Pandas.
Enhanced ability to create visualizations with Matplotlib to reveal trends and insights.
Gained a deeper understanding of Netflixâ€™s content release patterns and how data-driven analysis can inform business decisions.
This hands-on experience has been invaluable in working with complex datasets and deriving meaningful insights through data analysis. Looking forward to further exploring data science projects and uncovering more trends!
